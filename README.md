# sumo_db

## About

This is a work in progress. There's also [an article][sumo-article] about
sumo_db. This articles might be a little outdated by now, but can still
provide some basic information on how to get started.

**sumo_db** aims to ease db access for erlang applications. It offers a very
simple persistance layer capable of interacting with different db's, while
offering a consistent api to your code.


## Contact Us
If you find any **bugs** or have a **problem** while using this library, please
[open an issue][issue] in this repo (or a pull request :)).

## Overview

 * sumo_db gives you a standard way to define your db schema, regardless of the
 db implementation (mongo, mysql, redis, elasticsearch, etc.).

 * Your entities encapsulate behavior in code (i.e. functions in a module) and
 state in a `sumo:doc()` implementation.

 * `sumo` is the main module. It translates to and from sumo internal records
 into your own state.

 * Each store is managed by a worker pool of processes, each one using a module
 that implements `sumo_store` and calls the actual db driver
 (e.g: `sumo_store_mnesia`).

 * Some native domain events are supported, that are dispatched through a
 `gen_event:notify/2` automatically when an entity is created, updated, deleted.
 Also when a schema is created and when all entities of a given type are
 deleted. Events are described in [this article][domain-article].

 * Full conditional logic support when using `find_by/2` and `delete_by/2`
 function. You can find more information about the syntax of this conditional
 logic operators [here][cond-syntax].

 * Support for sorting (`asc` or `desc`) based on multiple fields unsing
 `find_by/5` and `find_all/4` functions. For example this
 `[{age, desc}, {name, asc}]]` will sort descendently by `age` and ascendently
  by `name`.

 * Support for docs/models validations through `sumo_changeset` (check out the
   [Changeset](#changeset) section).


## Backends, Stores and Repositories modules

These three concepts have a specific meaning in the context of sumo_db.

 - **Backend**: establishes and holds a single Database instance connection.

 - **Store**: implements the specific operations that modify the contents of the
 backend and retrieves the information it holds.

 - **Repository**: the application that uses `sumo_db` should implement one
 repository for each entity that's defined in it. The repository is the module
 that bridges the model and the store.


## Supported Backends/Adapters

 - [Mnesia](http://erlang.org/doc/man/mnesia.html) – **built-in with `sumo`**
 - [Riak](https://github.com/inaka/sumo_db_riak)
 - [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/inaka/sumo_db_pgsql)
 - [MySQL](https://github.com/inaka/sumo_db_mysql)
 - [MongoDB](https://github.com/inaka/sumo_db_mongo)
 - [ElasticSearch](https://github.com/inaka/sumo_db_elasticsearch)


## Implementing an Adapter

To implement an adapter, you must implement two specific behaviours:

 - [**sumo_backend**](./src/sumo_backend.erl) – DB connection
 - [**sumo_store**](./src/sumo_store.erl) – implements the **Sumo API**

 > You can check the implemented adapters mentioned above in order to have
   a better idea about how to build a custom adapter from scratch.


## Events

Sumo dispatches events when things happen. An Event has this structure:
```erlang
{EventId, Model, Event, Args}
```
- `EventId` is a `reference()` which identifies the event
- `Model` is the model where the event happend, for example, if we are creating a new entitiy in the model `people` the value of `Model` would be `people`.
- `Event` is the type of the event.
- `Args` extra data sent.

Supported types of events:

- `pre_persisted` just before persisting some entity. This event has the entity we want to persist as `Args`. It is dispatched on this function:
    - `sumo:persist/2`
- `persisted` just after persisting some entity. This event has the persisted entity as `Args`. This Event has the same `EventId` as its `pre_persisted` event. It is dispatched on this function:
    - `sumo:persist/2`
- `pre_delete_all` just before deleting all entities for a model. This event has no `Args`. It is dispatched on this function:
    - `sumo:delete_all/1`
- `deleted_all` just after deleting all entities for a model. This event has no `Args`. This Event has the same `EventId` as its `pre_delete_all` event. It is dispatched on this function:
    - `sumo:delete_all/1`
- `pre_deleted` just before deleting an entity. This event has the entity id as `Args`. It is dispatched on this function:
    - `sumo:delete/2`
- `deleted` just after deleting an entity. This event has the entity id as `Args`. This Event has the same `EventId` as its `pre_deleted` event. It is dispatched on this function:
    - `sumo:delete/2`
- `pre_deleted_total` just before deleting by some delete conditions. This event has the sumo conditions as `Args`. It is dispatched on this function:
    - `sumo:delete_by/2`
- `deleted_total` just after deleting by some delete conditions. This event has a list with the number of entities deleted and the delete conditions as `Args`. This Event has the same `EventId` as its `pre_deleted_total` event. It is dispatched on this function:
    - `sumo:delete_by/2`
- `pre_schema_created` just before creating a sumo schema. This event has no `Args`. It is dispatched on this function:
    - `sumo:create_schema/2`
- `schema_created` just after creating a sumo schema. This event has no `Args`. This Event has the same `EventId` as its `pre_schema_created` event. It is dispatched on this function:
    - `sumo:create_schema/2`

Sumo requires users to add their own `gen_event`'s in order to handle those events. In order to add them Users have to configure sumo properly. In the `config` file we can add them like this under `sumo_db` configuration:

```erlang
{events, [
   {'_', sumo_test_people_events_manager},
   {people, sumo_test_people_events_manager}
 ]}
```

Sumo allows us to add a `gen_event` to one type of model (i.e. `people`) or for all (`'_'`).


## Changeset

This feature is inspired by Elixir [Ecto.Changeset](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Changeset.html),
and the module that implements this feature is [sumo_changeset](./src/utils/sumo_changeset.erl).

### Changeset Usage Example

 > **NOTE:** This example uses [**FancyFlow**](https://github.com/ferd/fancyflow)
   in order to pipe changeset functions in a nicer way.

```erlang
%% suppose you have a model/doc `person`, and that module provides a function
%% to encapsulate model/doc creation
Person = person:new(<<"John">>, <<"Doe">>),

%% create the set of params/changes
Params = #{age => 33, id => 1, <<"last_name">> => <<"other">>},

%% run the changeset
Changeset = [pipe](people,
  sumo_changeset:cast(_, Person, Params, [id, first_name, last_name, age, status]),
  sumo_changeset:validate_required(_, [id, last_name, status]),
  sumo_changeset:validate_inclusion(_, status, [<<"active">>, <<"blocked">>]),
  sumo_changeset:validate_number(_, age, [{less_than_or_equal_to, 18}]),
  sumo_changeset:validate_length(_, last_name, [{min, 3}]),
  sumo_changeset:validate_format(_, last_name, <<"^[a-zA-Z]">>)),
```


## Examples

See: [**examples/blog**][example-blog] for a full example. To run it, while
being in the top level directory:

    make all blog

See: [**examples/custom_store**](examples/custom_store) for creating your own Store. To run it, follow the instructions in this README
